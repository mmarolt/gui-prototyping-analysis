# A comparative analysis of methods for generating graphical user interfaces from user requirements

  - **prototyping.ipynb:** Notebook that was used to generate the GUI prototypes
  - **prompts.py:** All 5 different prompts, that were evaluated in the study
  - **dataset_creation.ipynb:** Notebook that was used to generate the dataset of GUI descriptions
  - **rico_guis_details:** contains all annotations that where made for the evaluation of our generated GUI prototypes
    - the columns for the annotated scores have the following format: {UI number of the Text summary, the GUI is based on}/{Metric}/{Prompting approach}
  - **rico_guis_details:** contains the generated dataset of GUI descriptions
  - **generated_guis:** contains all GUIs that have been generated for the evaluation
  - **rico_guis:** contains the sampled rico GUIs, that were used as a base for our dataset
